# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The primary algorithm used is Linear Regression, and several Python libraries, including NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn (sklearn), are utilized for data processing, visualization, and model building.

## Introduction
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project involves analyzing a dataset of credit card transactions to identify fraudulent transactions. This is a crucial application of machine learning in the finance sector, helping to protect against financial fraud.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset provided by Kaggle. It contains information about credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset has 492 fraudulent transactions out of 284,807 transactions.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
